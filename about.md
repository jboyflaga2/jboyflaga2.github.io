I'm Jeremiah (Jboy) Flaga.

I'm a programmer :)

I already experienced being a .NET developer for 4 years.

Someday I would like to be part of a software development team that practices Pair Programming and TDD and is inclined to believe in what they call Software Craftsmanship because I also want to become a software craftsman myself.

I also want to become an expert in computer science and mathematics. But I think that will not happen anytime soon. Maybe 200 years from now? :D :D Mind you, I'm still alive during that time. :D :D

Happy coding!!!
