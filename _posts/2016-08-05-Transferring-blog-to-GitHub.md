title: I'm transferring my blog to Github
---

I want to always have a copy of my blog so I am going to transfer my blog from Blogger to GitHub Pages.

I already heard about GitHub Pages a few months ago. During that time, I tried to follow a tutorial to create a GitHub page with Jekyll **_from scratch_** because I wanted to understand everything that is contained in my site. But my attempt failed and I was frustrated. So I decided to continue using Blogger.

But today I was thinking that I do not have to understand everything about Jekyll to start using it.

So I googled for a tutorial on how to create blog using GitHub and found this: [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

I followed the tutorial and then ta-da!! Here I am now writing using GitHub Pages.

I will manually transfer my blog posts from my [previous blog, jboyflaga2.blogspot.com,](jboyflaga2.blogspot.com) in the coming days... or maybe tonight. There are only 12 posts in there. I think it will not consume too much of my time.

And because I am going to manage everything on this site from now on, I will encounter lots of problems. I am going to create a new post to contain links to the articles/authors that helped me solve my problems. I will just put here a link to that post in the future when I start solving the problems.

Here are some of the problems I have to solve:

1. Adding a search box
2. Adding tags
3. Adding comments section
